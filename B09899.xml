            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>THe Book call'd Miſtreſs <hi>James</hi>'s Vindication,</l>
            <l>Doth ſeem to me but her great Indignation</l>
            <l>Againſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> and Diſſenters too:</l>
            <l>She for the Church of <hi>England</hi> makes adoe,</l>
            <l>Calling her Chriſts Spouſe, yet ſhe's miſtaken,</l>
            <l>Chriſts Spouſe is ſhe that is by Her forſaken:</l>
            <l>In every form the Innocent are his,</l>
            <l>They'r ſuch as truly give him Kiſs for Kiſs.</l>
            <l>The New Church and <hi>Calvins</hi> are alike,</l>
            <l>When they get up, they do their Brethren ſtrike;</l>
            <l>They both are Perſecutors, and I find,</l>
            <l>Such ſilly Formaliſts are very blind</l>
            <l>To things of God; for none of them can tell</l>
            <l>What is in Truth, either in Heaven or Hell;</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:191981:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Or God, or Devil, they all court the Letter,</l>
            <l>And yet I ſee their evil doth them fetter,</l>
            <l>They would have <hi>Liberty,</hi> but cannot love</l>
            <l>Their Neigbour as themſelves, but ſtill do move,</l>
            <l>That they may have Dominion over others;</l>
            <l>That is the Daughters trick, and eke the Mothers</l>
            <l>Though at each other they do chide and baul,</l>
            <l>No Barrel the better Herring amongſt them all.</l>
            <l>Our Gracious King doth keep the Peace,</l>
            <l>And yet their wrath and mallice does not ceaſe.</l>
            <l>Leave of debate, and learn to live in Love,</l>
            <l>Then you will know what is the God above,</l>
            <l>And eke his Son, whom you do ſeem to Honour,</l>
            <l>Yet never come to fight under his Banner;</l>
            <l>Againſt the evil Nature in your ſelves,</l>
            <l>And ſo you run upon the ſands and ſhelves;</l>
            <l>Of vain contention, and vain jangling, for</l>
            <l>I ſee you all the ways of Truth abhor.</l>
            <l>You ſaw that Conſcience is no perfect guide,</l>
            <l>And therein I do find that you backſlide;</l>
            <l>For that doth never guide us to do evil,</l>
            <l>He that denies the Truth, he is a Devil.</l>
            <l>You like <hi>Goliah</hi> think to run me down;</l>
            <l>But I have little <hi>David</hi> (though you frown)</l>
            <l>Can ſmite you with his ſtone, that is the truth,</l>
            <l>Though you have been a Warriour from your Youth:</l>
            <l>I matter not your Spear, nor yet your Shield,</l>
            <l>I know the power I have ſhall make you yield;</l>
            <l>With your own Sword I make no doubt to tame ye,</l>
            <l>Though your proud Doctors at your Church do blame me.</l>
            <l>I plead for Truth, and for true innocence,</l>
            <l>That keeps the Conſcience void of all offence</l>
            <l>To God or Man, that loves you every one,</l>
            <l>And would have all build on the Corner Stone;</l>
            <l>The Rock of Ages, and not harm each other,</l>
            <l>But have reſpect to Charity our Mother;</l>
            <l>And do your duty alſo to your King,</l>
            <l>That you may come and <hi>ALLELUJAH'S</hi> Sing.</l>
